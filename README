These are a couple of improvements in the new version of spotifynotifiergrowl:

1) Now no need to register the application with growl manually. Check
"notifygrowl.cs" for relevant code.

2) Now displays album-cover/album-art of the current playing track in the
notification.

3) Hide the window after running the ".exe" application. Check
"CustomNoWindow.bat" for relevance.

4) Now it doesn't dislpay the track notification when you play again after the
spotify is paused.
