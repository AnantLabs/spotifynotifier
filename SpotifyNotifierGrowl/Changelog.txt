Improvements in version 1.1

1) Now no need to register the application with growl manually. Check
"notifygrowl.cs" for relevant code.

2) Now displays album-cover/album-art of the current playing track in the
notification.

3) Hide the window after running the ".exe" application. Check
"CustomNoWindow.bat" for relevance.

4) Now it doesn't dislpay the track notification when you play again after the
spotify is paused.

Thanks to Matthew Javellana @ mmjavellana@gmail.com for improvements in version 1.1.

Improvements in version 1.2

1) Now uses Growl C# API to register application and to show notifications.

2) As some of the methods were not supported for .NET < 4.0 so now the zip includes  

    2.1) SpotifyNotifyGrowl_NET2.0.exe for those who are using .NET version 2.0 (I suppose nobody is).

    2.2) SpotifyNotifyGrowl_NET3.5.exe for those who are using .NET version 3.5.

    2.3) SpotifyNotifyGrowl.exe for those who are using .NET version 4.0.

3) It also includes a compile_NET4.0.bat file to compile the project after making some changes to it.
